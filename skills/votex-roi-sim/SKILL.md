description: Simulate Votex/The Vault vote-buy ROI for a validator gauge, including bid dilution, acquired veV, gauge-directed SOL, optional SFDP match, revenue, net profit, ROI, and break-even sizing. Use when comparing Votex bid amounts or estimating revenue from gauge-directed stake.

# Votex ROI Simulation

Read [installed bundle and configuration](references/shared-runtime.md) before running commands. Resolve paths from this loaded SKILL.md, not the session working directory.

Set `SOLANA_RPC_URL` in the local runtime to your Helius mainnet URL. No RPC credential is bundled. Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` from the resolved bundle root before first use.

Model allocation as bid share:

```text
acquiredVev = totalVev * bid / (otherBids + bid)
directedSol = acquiredVev * gaugeDirectedSol / totalEpochGaugeVev
revenueSol = directedSol * matchMultiplier * lamportsPerStakedSol / 1e9
roiPct = (revenueSol * solUsd - bid) / bid * 100
```

Run:

```bash
bun src/skills/votex-roi-sim/scripts/simulate.ts \
  --epoch current \
  --gauge <YOUR_GAUGE_PUBKEY> \
  --bids 10,20,50,100 \
  --match-multiplier 1
```

`--gauge` is required; there is no default validator gauge.

Useful overrides: `--current-bid`, `--other-bids`, `--total-vev`, `--total-gauge-vev`, `--lamports-per-staked-sol`, `--sol-usd`, and `--format json`.

The helper reads VotaFi stats, SolanaVault stakebot data, Jupiter SOL/USD, and Helius RPC. If active-epoch stats are unpublished, use only a user-approved comparable epoch or explicit overrides.

Report inputs, sources, assumptions, and a bid comparison range. Treat results as estimates and recompute near the bidding deadline.

The script validates that the supplied gauge is active and belongs to The Vault. Invalid/duplicate options, nonpositive bids, nonfinite values and zero gauge-veV denominators fail rather than producing partial or null results. A selected historical epoch still uses the latest stakebot stake pool and current SOL price unless manually overridden; report this mixed-time scope explicitly. The constant match multiplier does not model SFDP caps or marginal eligibility. Use `1` unless a justified effective multiplier applies to the whole modeled allocation.
