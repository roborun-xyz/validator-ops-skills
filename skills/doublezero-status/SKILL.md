description: Quickly check DoubleZero Edge client status on Solana validator hosts. Use when Codex is asked to check DoubleZero, DZ, doublezerod, DoubleZero Edge, BGP tunnel status, edge-solana-shreds multicast, DoubleZero routes, DoubleZero latency, or recent DoubleZero logs on configured validator hosts.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires Bash and SSH. Targets need Linux, systemd, iproute2, GNU timeout and DoubleZero.

# DoubleZero Status

Read [installed bundle and configuration](references/shared-runtime.md) before running commands. Resolve paths from this loaded SKILL.md, not the session working directory.

## Overview

Use this skill to perform a fast, read-only DoubleZero health check over SSH and summarize whether the host is connected to the DoubleZero mainnet-beta network and whether the DoubleZero Edge Solana shreds multicast signal is present.

Prefer the bundled helper for normal checks:

```bash
src/skills/doublezero-status/scripts/check-doublezero-status.sh <SSH_ALIAS>
```

If no hosts are supplied, use the host aliases requested by the user. For vague requests like "check dz status", resolve active mainnet primaries from the operator's own verified inventory. If none is configured, ask for the target aliases before connecting. Read the default host inventory before asking for aliases. `fleet.json` covers SFDP production checks only and may omit backups; use it only when those explicitly selected instances are the intended targets. There are no built-in fleet defaults.

## Workflow

1. Resolve aliases and roles from operator-owned inventory (read `VALIDATOR_OPS_HOST_INVENTORY` or `~/.config/validator-ops/hosts.md`; see `references/inventory-references-hosts.md`). Do not treat a bundled example or another operator's inventory as a target selection.
2. Run the helper from the resolved bundle root with the target SSH aliases.
3. Report:
   - UTC and local check time. The helper defaults local time to `Asia/Shanghai`; override with `LOCAL_TIME_ZONE` when needed.
   - `doublezerod.service` active/substate, PID, restart count, and start timestamp.
   - `doublezero status` tunnel rows, especially `BGP Session Up`.
   - Edge signal: `P:edge-solana-shreds` present or missing.
   - `doublezero0` and `doublezero1` addresses.
   - Route counts for each DoubleZero interface.
   - Closest latency rows from `doublezero latency`.
   - Recent warnings/errors from `journalctl -u doublezerod`.
   - Client upgrade warning if the CLI prints one.
4. Keep the final answer concise. Do not paste full route tables or full latency tables unless the user asks.

## Helper

The helper runs read-only commands:

```bash
src/skills/doublezero-status/scripts/check-doublezero-status.sh <host> [host...]
```

Exit `1` reports at least one SSH collection failure; it is not a parsed health verdict. Interpret the collected evidence below. Invalid aliases are rejected before connecting; SSH uses batch mode and bounded connection/keepalive waits.

The helper targets Linux hosts with GNU `timeout`; DoubleZero CLI calls have a 30-second bound. Timeout output means incomplete evidence, not a healthy service.

It uses `ssh`, `systemctl show`, `ip -br addr`, `ip route`, `doublezero status`, `doublezero latency`, `doublezero routes`, and `journalctl`. It does not restart services, modify routes, or change DoubleZero configuration.

## Interpretation

- Healthy DoubleZero baseline: `doublezerod` is active/running, `NRestarts=0` or explained, both `doublezero0` and `doublezero1` exist, tunnel status shows `BGP Session Up`, route counts are nonzero, and recent logs do not show repeated errors.
- Healthy Edge signal: `doublezero status` contains a `Multicast` tunnel row whose multicast group includes `P:edge-solana-shreds`. Report this separately from generic DoubleZero tunnel health.
- `doublezero1` is typically the multicast/shreds interface, but do not rely on interface name alone. Treat `P:edge-solana-shreds` as the strongest local Edge signal.
- If `edge_signal=missing` but DoubleZero BGP is healthy, say the host is on DoubleZero but Edge Solana shreds multicast was not detected.
- `doublezero latency` may print a client upgrade warning. Treat this as maintenance advice, not service failure, unless the user asked for upgrade readiness.
- `doublezero routes` can contain many rows. Count states or sample the first rows; avoid dumping all routes.
- Kernel interface state `UNKNOWN` is normal for these tunnel-style interfaces when BGP sessions and routes are present.

## Fallback Commands

If the helper is unavailable, run this pattern per host:

```bash
ssh <host> 'echo HOST=$(hostname);
echo UTC=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ);
echo LOCAL=$(TZ=Asia/Shanghai date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z);
systemctl is-active doublezerod;
systemctl show doublezerod -p ActiveState -p SubState -p MainPID -p NRestarts -p ExecMainStartTimestamp --no-pager;
doublezero -e mainnet-beta status 2>&1;
doublezero -e mainnet-beta status 2>&1 | grep -F "P:edge-solana-shreds" || true;
ip -br addr show doublezero0 2>/dev/null || true;
ip -br addr show doublezero1 2>/dev/null || true;
printf "doublezero0_routes="; ip route | grep -c " dev doublezero0 " || true;
printf "doublezero1_routes="; ip route | grep -c " dev doublezero1 " || true;
doublezero -e mainnet-beta latency 2>&1 | head -25;
journalctl -u doublezerod -p warning..alert -n 20 --no-pager --utc'
```
