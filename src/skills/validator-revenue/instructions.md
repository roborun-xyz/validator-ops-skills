description: Fetch Solana validator historical gross and net revenue by epoch, including voting rewards, commission rewards, Jito rewards, BAM Boost JitoSOL subsidies, voting compensation, voting fees, and Marinade bond payments when present. Use for revenue history and per-epoch income; default to the last 30 completed mainnet epochs.

# Validator Revenue

Read [installed bundle and configuration](../shared/runtime.md) before running commands. Resolve paths from this loaded SKILL.md, not the session working directory.

Install the workspace dependencies from the resolved bundle root with `bun install --frozen-lockfile` when `node_modules` is absent.

Run from the resolved bundle root:

```bash
bun src/skills/validator-revenue/scripts/revenue.ts \
  --vote-account <VOTE_ACCOUNT> \
  --epochs 30
```

Use `--validator <VOTE_OR_IDENTITY>` for identity resolution, `--include-current` only when requested, and `--format markdown|csv|json` for output.

The helper uses the repository Helius mainnet RPC, JPool/SVT history, Trillium epoch-specific identity resolution, Jito's official validator rewards and JitoSOL/SOL ratio APIs, Jito's public BAM Boost Merkle distributions, and Marinade's validator-bonds API.

Calculate validator-operator Jito MEV revenue from Jito's official validator rewards as `floor(mev_revenue * mev_commission_bps / 10_000)`. Do not use JPool/SVT's raw `jitoReward` as revenue because that inflow can include returned Tip Distribution Account rent. Report the raw SVT inflow and excluded difference for reconciliation, but exclude the difference from gross and net revenue.

BAM Boost accounting follows JIP-31's epoch-lagged distribution: a subsidy earned in epoch `N` is read from claim distributor epoch `N+1`. Treat presence in Jito's Merkle tree as an allocation, not proof of receipt. Derive the official distributor and Claim Status PDAs and check them at finalized commitment through the repository Helius RPC. Mark an allocation `claimed` only when the Claim Status account exists and its owner, discriminator, claimant, and amount match; an absent Claim Status marks a positive published allocation `unclaimed`, while malformed or mismatched Claim Status data fails verification. Report allocated and claimed amounts separately in raw JitoSOL and historical SOL equivalent.

Convert allocated JitoSOL to SOL with Jito's latest official daily JitoSOL/SOL ratio at or before the first confirmed block of claim epoch `N+1`, retain the raw JitoSOL amount and rate timestamp in both UTC and Asia/Shanghai for auditability, and include the allocated SOL amount in gross and net revenue. Use that same historical rate for the claimed SOL equivalent so allocated and claimed values are comparable; claiming is a receipt-state change and must not add the reward to revenue a second time. Never assume 1 JitoSOL equals 1 SOL.

Use [JIP-31](https://forum.jito.network/t/jip-31-introduce-a-bam-early-adopter-subsidy-programme/909) for the earning-to-claim epoch convention, `https://storage.googleapis.com/jito-bam-boost/mainnet/<CLAIM_EPOCH>/merkle_tree.json` for published allocations, Jito's official [`jito-bam-boost-cli`](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-bam-boost-cli) for PDA and Claim Status semantics, and Jito's [`jitosol_sol_ratio`](https://www.jito.network/docs/jitosol/jitosol-liquid-staking/for-developers/stake-pool-api/#9-jitosolsol-ratio) API for historical exchange ratios.

Report the completed epoch range, bond status, per-epoch revenue components, official Jito MEV commission, excluded SVT Jito inflows, BAM Boost allocated and claimed JitoSOL, historical allocated and claimed SOL equivalents, allocation and claim statuses, totals, missing rows, and assumptions. Use `validator-performance` for credits, rank, skip rate, and block production.

## Local profiles and first use

Pass `--profile NAME` and optionally `--config PATH` to reuse a verified local validator. Without an explicit account or profile, use the configured default or sole profile. Several profiles without a default require an explicit selection. `--vote-account` / `--validator` override the saved target for this run only; an explicitly selected profile still supplies its RPC environment reference.

If configuration or RPC credentials are missing, follow `../onboarding/instructions.md` configuration setup or repair, ask only for missing fields, then resume the requested check. SSH and signing keys are unnecessary. `SOLANA_RPC_URL` remains supported for account-only commands; configure it locally rather than pasting API keys into chat. The resolver checks mainnet and the live vote/identity pair; an identity change in a saved profile requires an explicit profile refresh through onboarding. Explicit inputs must resolve to a unique active validator or an existing on-chain vote account. Existing zero-stake vote accounts are supported for historical queries; a retired identity without an active mapping requires its vote account.
